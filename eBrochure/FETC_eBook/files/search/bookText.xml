               RFID

               •  The Year 2006-2012 : Introduced flat-rate pay-per-use IR DSRC ETC
                 In 2006, FETC successfully launched flat-rate pay-per-use ETC among 23 toll plazas with IR DSRC
                 technology, and the utilization rate had remained at approximately 40% for years, which was not
                 sufficient to implement the policy – achieving a distance-based and multi-lane free flow (MLFF)
                 nationwide ETC system.


               •  The Year 2012-2014: Migrated from IR DSRC to RFID, from Barrier Base to
                 MLFF
                 Therefore, RFID was introduced to Taiwanese road users later on in 2012 and with a rapid growth of
                 public enrolment. The ETC usage rate accelerated from 43% to 94% from May 2012 to Jan 2014
                 and the system was compatible with both IR DSRC and RFID coexisting operation. This 1.5-years
                 migration process with well-planned rollout strategy and incentive programs allow sufficient ETC
                 penetration and society readiness for TANFB and FETC introducing MLFF with 319 gantries to road
                 users on December 30th 2013. All the efforts to seamless migration not only from IR DSRC on-board-
                 unit (OBU) to RFID tag, but also from barrier-based tolling to MLFF have paid off. Currently more than
                 7 million users in Taiwan benefit from the ETC with more than 6 billion accumulated transactions.
